# Packman

This is a very basic packman game, based on tutorial by Ania Kubow, done as a practical project to refresh vanilla JavaScript. 

Technology used: 
- HTML 
- CSS
- Javascript
To move pacman, you have to use arrow keys.

Currently ghosts move at random. In the future I am planning for them to move according to pacman's moves.
